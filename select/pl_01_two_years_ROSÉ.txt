How'd it all fall apart?
You were right here before,
in my arms
Now you're invisible
But the heartbreak's physical
Got a place, moved away
Somewhere with a different code,
Different state
Still feels miserable
God, it's so chemical
All that I know
Is I can't let you go
It's been two years
And you're still not gone
Doesn't make sense that
I can't move on
Yeah, I try, I try, I try, I try
But this love never dies
Two years
Since you've been in my bеd
Even had a funeral for
you in my head
Yeah, I try, I try, I try, I try
But this love never dies
Another night, another vice
Even try with someone new,
someone nice
I'll always hate
the fact that you
Ruined everybody after you
I'm always coming back to you
It's been two years
And you're still not gone
Doesn't make sense that
I can't move on
Yeah, I try, I try, I try, I try
But this love never dies
It's been two years
Since you've been in my bed
Even had a funeral
for you in my head
Yeah, I try, I try, I try, I try
But this love never dies
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
And I'm never gonna
let you go, go
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Maybe I'm just sick
And this is how it's gonna be
Maybe this is all I know
And I know it's not you, it's me
'Cause it's been two years
And you're still not gone
Doesn't make sense that
I can't move on
Yeah, I try, I try, I try, I try
But this love never dies
It's been two years
Since you've been in my bed
Even had a funeral
for you in my head
Yeah, I try, I try, I try, I try
But this love never dies
