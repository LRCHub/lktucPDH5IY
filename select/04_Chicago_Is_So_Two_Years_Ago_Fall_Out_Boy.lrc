[00:07.36] My heart is on my sleeve
[00:10.19] Wear it like a bruise or black eye
[00:12.77] My badge, my witness means that I believed
[00:18.42] Every single lie you said
[00:30.92] 
[00:24.72] 'Cause every pane of glass that your pebbles tap,
[00:27.07] Negates the pains I went through to avoid you
[00:33.27] And every little pat on the shoulder for attention
[00:36.24] Fails to mention I still hate you
[00:52.74] 
[00:41.36] But there's a light on in Chicago
[00:45.51] And I know I should be home
[00:49.86] All the colors of the street signs
[00:52.68] They remind me of the pick-up truck out in front of your neighbor's house
[01:29.18] 
[00:59.76] She took me down and said
[01:02.75] "Boys like you are overrated" (So save your breath)
[01:09.03] Loaded words and loaded friends
[01:12.35] Are loaded guns to our heads
[01:26.35] 
[01:17.60] 'Cause every pane of glass that your pebbles tap
[01:19.79] Negates the pains I went through to avoid you
[01:26.04] And every little pat on the shoulder for attention
[01:28.89] Fails to mention I still hate you
[01:45.39] 
[01:33.93] But there's a light on in Chicago
[01:38.18] And I know I should be home
[01:42.51] All the colors of the street signs
[01:45.46] They remind me of the pick-up truck out in front of your neighbor's house
[02:21.96] 
[01:52.85] You want apologies?
[01:55.06] Girl, you might hold your breath
[01:57.02] Until your breathing stops forever, forever
[02:01.35] The only thing you'll get is this curse on your lips
[02:05.63] I hope they taste of me forever
[02:21.13] 
[02:08.82] And there's a light on in Chicago (every pane of glass)
[02:13.04] And I know I should be home (every pane of glass)
[02:17.30] And the colors of the street signs
[02:20.31] They remind me of the pick-up truck out in front of your neighbor's
[02:26.51] With every breath, I wish your body will be broken again, again
[02:34.52] With every breath, I wish your body will be broken again, again
[02:42.43] (Well there's a light on)
[02:43.99] With every breath, I wish your body will be broken again, again
[02:51.08] (Light)
[02:52.27] With every breath, I wish your body will be broken again
