[00:07.63] My heart is on my sleeve
[00:10.44] Wear it like a bruise or black eye
[00:13.24] My badge, my witness
[00:16.41] Means that I believed
[00:18.96] Every single lie you said
[00:31.46] 
[00:25.28] 'Cause every pane of glass that your pebbles tap
[00:27.36] Negates the pains I went through to avoid you
[00:33.79] And every little pat on the shoulder for attention
[00:36.47] Fails to mention I still hate you
[00:52.97] 
[00:41.65] But there's a light on in Chicago
[00:46.08] And I know I should be home
[00:50.14] All the colors of the street signs
[00:53.12] They remind me of the pick-up truck
[00:56.32] Out in front of your neighbor's house
[01:14.82] 
[01:00.08] She took me down and said
[01:03.27] "Boys like you are overrated, so save your breath"
[01:09.04] Loaded words and loaded friends
[01:12.57] Are loaded guns to our heads
[01:26.57] 
[01:18.06] 'Cause every pane of glass that your pebbles tap
[01:20.04] Negates the pains I went through to avoid you
[01:26.20] And every little pat on the shoulder for attention
[01:29.16] Fails to mention I still hate you
[01:45.66] 
[01:34.11] But there's a light on in Chicago
[01:38.67] And I know I should be home
[01:42.73] All the colors of the street signs
[01:45.78] They remind me of the pick-up truck
[01:49.01] Out in front of your neighbor's house
[02:07.51] 
[01:53.14] You want apologies?
[01:55.32] Girl, you might hold your breath
[01:57.51] Until your breathing stops forever, forever
[02:01.66] The only thing you'll get is this curse on your lips
[02:05.66] I hope they taste of me forever
[02:21.16] 
[02:08.85] And there's a light on in Chicago (every pane of glass)
[02:13.51] And I know I should be home (every pane of)
[02:17.37] And all the colors of the street signs (every pane of glass)
[02:20.52] They remind me of the pick-up truck
[02:23.79] Out in front of your neighbor's
[02:39.29] 
[02:26.73] With every breath, I wish your body will be broken again, again
[02:35.22] With every breath, I wish your body would be broken again, again
[02:42.67] (And there's a light on)
[02:43.99] With every breath, I wish your body will be broken again, again
[02:51.70] (Light) with every breath, I wish your body would be broken again
