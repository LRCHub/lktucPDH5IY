[00:37.42] It's been two years since I spilled out my heart
[00:41.47] On a blank page some seem to think that it's art
[00:45.61] But I'm just trying to fight my demons
[00:48.43] Always learning from my mistakes
[00:50.62] I'm still trying to make a difference
[00:52.83] Forever looking for my place
[01:06.83] 
[00:55.61] Forgive me
