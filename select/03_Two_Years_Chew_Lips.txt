Followed you down to the beach tonight
Wearing two coats but nothing besides
Forget that we're away from home
Pretend we've got a beach of our own
Always before but never again
In the tall white grass where we ran and slept
I lost my head but the ideas came
Sweating out words like a fevered game
And now that seems like it was lost in time
But for those two years he was a friend of mine

Summer's so long and it's running away
I lost my chain in the river that day
Watched that fire in the silent dark
And i found you crying in the back of your car
In the small hours while the embers glowed
And the light showed drops on your blanket folds
I let you rest from your tired life
Carving that soil with your daddy's knife
And now it seems it was lost in time
But for those two years he was a friend of mine

Followed you down to the beach tonight
Followed you down to the beach tonight
Followed you down to the beach tonight
